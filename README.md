# PhilosophersWithStewardThread
A program in cpp language that emulates the behavior of philosophers. Five philosophers are sitting at a round table. They spend their lives alternating between eating and thinking. The food supply in a philosopher's plate is endless. To eat food, the philosopher needs two forks: one he takes in his right hand, the other in his left. The philosophers were given only five forks at all. There is one fork between each pair of philosophers. Therefore, they agreed that each of them uses only those forks that lie next to him (left and right). Based on Windows.h library; Multithreading.
